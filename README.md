# Well, I actually don't know how repository works, but my idea is that I CAN figure it out by playing with it. Okay, so now I'm on job searching. One trouble is it takes a lot time to search for one position from different recruiting websites like LinkedIn, Indeed. Also, I found posting date of some jobs in LinkedIn sometimes far different from real data from employers. Well I cannot go all employers one by one, so I start thinking if there is any program which could crawl the career page of targeting companies, maybe every week, and capture the new posting matching my keywords, and then send all links back to me via an email. I know you can subscribe job posting from some companies, but not all of them outthere.
