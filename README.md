Well, I actually don't know how repository works, but my idea is that I CAN figure it out by playing with it. Okay, so now I'm on job searching. One trouble is it takes a lot time to search for one position from different recruiting websites like LinkedIn, Indeed. Also, I found posting date of some jobs in LinkedIn sometimes far different from real data from employers. Well I cannot go all employers one by one, so I start thinking if there is any program which could crawl the career page of targeting companies, maybe every week, and capture the new posting matching my keywords, and then send all links back to me via an email. I know you can subscribe job posting from some companies, but not all of them outthere. 
I would be happy to first outline the process, and then divide into sub-tasks... To be continued

OK, I figure out it might be too ambitious to track endless webpages. A more practical way would be first create a list consisting of career pages of your targeted companies, like
tgt_companies_list = () 

it could be any number, and you can add later

tgt_companies_list.append()

Then, a keywords list matching your job preference, like position, duties
job_preference = ()

Then, the process would be scanning those company webpage with keywords, if match well, record the link and send it back to my email address.

BTW, I copied a programming counting the words frequency of a webpage, hopefuly it will help in the future.
